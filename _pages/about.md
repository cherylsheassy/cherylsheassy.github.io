About Cheryl
======
I am a PhD student in Communication Arts at [the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://commarts.wisc.edu/). I study political communication and media sociology, with the particular interest in civic resistance, digital-enabled networked protest and scientific knowledge popularization. 

I received my MPhil in Communication in 2021 and B.S. in Journalism and Communication in 2019 from [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.com.cuhk.edu.hk/zh-TW/). I have worked on several research projects concerning [the Hong Kong protest](https://sites.google.com/view/antielabsurvey-eng), China news and Freedom of press. For more details, please read my full academic CV as below (updated Sept, 2022).
