excerpt: 'One important aspect of the 2019 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement was its efforts to appeal to the international community for sup- port. While political activists lobbied foreign governments, and overseas Hong Konger associations held rallies and other activities, many ordinary Hong Kong citizens intentionally participated in the “international front” through social-media-based public diplomacy. This article examines pro- movement public diplomacy via Twitter, identifying its common narratives and main targets. It also highlights the tension between bottom-up public diplomacy by ordinary citizens and elite-led lobbying work. Thus, the article demonstrates both the opportunities and challenges that social media have introduced to a networked social movement.'
